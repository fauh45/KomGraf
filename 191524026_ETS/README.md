# Happy Mackarel

Made by Muhammad Fauzan Lubis (191524026)

### Description

A lot of mackarel colonies are happily swimming in the vast ocean. Following the ocean currents, and with a little of their energy trying to steer to where they want to go. Even though not fast, because they're chilling in some part of the ocean, with their boys.

This program is made for Computer Graphic class, with inspiration from one of the [Scandinavian pattern](https://medialoot.com/item/seamless-scandinavian-vector-patterns/) I found in the internet. A little bit simpler, but then made it into an animation. The inspiration image can also be found in `inspiration` folder. While the demo video can be found in `screencast` folder.

### How to Use

1. Open the project in Godot (made in v3.3.2.stable.official)
2. Run the program
3. Look at the happy mackarel swimming in the ocean
4. You can interact with it using the mouse, click, hold, and drag anywhere in the screen, there should be a hint to show you what speed it will set if you release the mouse click
5. Have fun!
